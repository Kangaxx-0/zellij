# What is this?

This is a fork of [Zellij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellij), the feature-rich terminal workspcae. This fork aims to experiment with new features and improvements that may not yet be incorporated into the main Zellij project. 


## Why This Fork Exists

The original Zellij project is under active development, but due to priority constraints, some PRs and feature implementations might be delayed. This fork serves as an experimental ground for adding more features and trying out new things. While the new features are mostly functional, they may contain bugs.

Importantly, this fork also serves as a test bed for my plugin development work, which requires various API changes to Zellij. These changes are critical for the functionality of my plugins, such as [first-zellij-plugin](https://github.com/Kangaxx-0/first-zellij-plugin).


## Branching Strategy

This fork maintains two primary branches:

- `main`: This branch is in sync with the upstream Zellij repository to keep up-to-date with the latest changes.
- `dev`: This branch diverges from main and includes experimental features and changes.

Pull requests with new features from the dev branch will be submitted to the main Zellij repository. Conflicts might occur and are part of the experimental nature of this fork.


## Disclaimer

This fork is experimental and while most features should work, they might not be as stable as the features in the main Zellij repository.

## License

This fork is under the same license as the original Zellij project
